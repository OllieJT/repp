Contributions are welcome!

This project is early-stage, so detailed guidance on methodology and architecture isn't available yet. That said, the codebase is simple enough that small changes and additions should be straightforward.

**Before starting work**, please [open an issue](../../issues/new) to discuss your idea. This helps avoid rejected pull requests and wasted effort.
